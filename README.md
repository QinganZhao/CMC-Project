## Introduction
This study aims to better understand people's expectations and behaviors when using IPAs. According to the relevant literatures, we found that IPAs perform differently in social-oriented and task-oriented converations. Through the experiment, we got some insights in factors that can influence the user experience between the interactions of human and IPAs and phenomena which would assist in helping improve future IPA designs.
